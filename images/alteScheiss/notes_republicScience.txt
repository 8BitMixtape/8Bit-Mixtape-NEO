Admittedly, scientific authority is not distributed evenly throughout the body of scientists ; some distinguished members of the profession predominate over others of a more junior standing . But the authority of scientific opinion remains essentially mutual ; it is established between scientists, not above them . Scientists exercise their authority over each other . Admittedly , the body of scientists, as a whole , does uphold the authority of science over the lay public . It controls thereby also the process by which young men are trained to become members of the scientific profession. But once the novice has reached the grade of an independent scientist , there is no longer any superior above him . His submission to scientific opinion is entailed now in his joining a chain of mutual appreciations, within which he is called upon to bear his equal share of responsibility for the authority to which he submits.

Any attempt at guiding scientific research towards a purpose other than its own is an attempt to deflect it from the advancement of science.

For the only justification for the pursuit of scientific research in universities lies in the fact that the universities provide an intimate communion for the formation of scientific opinion, free from corrupting intrusions and distractions. For though scientific discoveries eventually diffuse into all people's thinking, the general public cannot participate in the intellectual milieu in which discoveries are made.

The authority of science is essentially traditional.
